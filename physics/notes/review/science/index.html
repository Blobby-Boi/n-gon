		<h1 class='underlined'>Hypothesis, Theory, and Law</h1>
		<p>
			In science the words hypothesis, theory, and law have special meanings that don't exactly agree with how they are used outside
			of science.
		</p>
		<p>
			A
			<strong>hypothesis</strong> is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. A hypothesis is an educated guess about something. Often
			scientists test a hypothesis through experimentation.
		</p>
		<p>
			A
			<strong>scientific theory</strong> is a well-confirmed explanation of a phenomenon. Theories have been rigorously tested many
			times. The word theory outside of science is used for guesses, but in science it is the highest level of knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			A
			<strong>scientific law</strong> is a similar to a theory, but with some limitations. They don't offer any explanation, just a
			relationship. Additionally laws generally only apply to a limit situation. Laws are often conclusions drawn from some
			initial postulates.
		</p>

		<h1 class='underlined'>Probability and Truth</h1>
		<p>
			value of Bayesian probability (no true and false, only % chance to be true)
		</p>
		<p>
			scientists shouldn't say they believe in things 100%, things have a probability or being true or not

		<h1 class='underlined'>Human Biases</h1>
		<p>
			science as a progression away from human biases
		</p>
		<p>
			self centered: the universe is centered around me > Earth > Sun > there is no center
			<br> relativity: velocity only exists relative to something
		</p>

		<h1 class='underlined'>Perception and Reality</h1>
		<p>
			real things, we can't directly sense: E-M spectrum, subatomic particles, gravity fields, electric fields, electricity
		</p>
		<p>sensory illusions: why does metal feel cold, optical illusions,
		</p>
		<p>delusions: some people believe things that are in their mind exist outside their mind (ghosts)
		</p>
		<p>
			"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." - Philip K. Dick
		</p>

		<h1 class='underlined'>Modeling of Reality</h1>
		<p>Science builds models to simplified a narrow aspect of reality. These models are often very accurate as long as they stay
			within a range of values. For example newtonian physics works very well, but it becomes inaccurate near the sped of light.
			We can switch to relativistic physics to get accurate predictions near the speed of light.</p>
