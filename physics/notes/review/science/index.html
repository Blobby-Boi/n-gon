		<h1 class='underlined'>Scientific Method</h1>
		<p>

			Thinking scientifically comes at a high cost that many people are willing to pay.
			That cost is learning to admit you are wrong.

		<h1 class='underlined'>Hypothesis, Theory, and Law</h1>
		<p>
			In science the words hypothesis, law, and, theory have special meanings that don't exactly agree with how they are used outside of science.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			A <strong>scientific law</strong> summarizes the results of experiments or observations.
			<li>They don't offer any explanation, just a relationship.</li>
			<li>Laws often only apply to a model, not directly to the real world.</li>
			<li>Scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the scientific method.</li>
			<p>Examples: <a href="">Ohm's Law</a>, <a href="">Universal Gravitation</a>, <a href="">Coulomb's law</a>, <a href="">Kirchhoff's laws</a> </p>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon.
			<li>A hypothesis is an educated guess.</li>
			<li>Scientists test hypotheses through experimentation.</li>
			<p>Examples: <a href=""> </a>, <a href=""> </a>, <a href=""> </a>, <a href=""> </a> </p>
		</p>

		<br>
		<p>
			A <strong>scientific theory</strong> is a well-confirmed explanation of a phenomenon.
			<li>Theories have been rigorously tested many times.</li>
			<li>The word theory outside of science is used for guesses, but in science it is the highest level of knowledge. </li>
			<p>Examples: <a href="">big bang theory</a>, <a href="">quantum field theory</a>, <a href="">evolution</a>, <a href="">germ theory</a> </p>

		<h1 class='underlined'>Probability and Truth</h1>
		<p>
			value of Bayesian probability (no true and false, only % chance to be true)
		</p>
		<p>
			scientists shouldn't say they believe in things 100%, things have a probability or being true or not
		</p>
		<p>
			Is there an elephant less than 100m away from you right now?

		<h1 class='underlined'>Human Biases</h1>
		<p>
			science as a progression away from human biases
		</p>
		<p>
			self centered: the universe is centered around me > Earth > Sun > there is no center
			<br> relativity: velocity only exists relative to something
		</p>

		<h1 class='underlined'>Perception and Reality</h1>
		<p>
			real things, we can't directly sense: E-M spectrum, subatomic particles, gravity fields, electric fields, electricity
		</p>
		<p>sensory illusions: why does metal feel cold, optical illusions,
		</p>
		<p>delusions: some people believe things that are in their mind exist outside their mind (ghosts)
		</p>
		<p>
			"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."
			<br>- Philip K. Dick
		</p>

		<h1 class='underlined'>Modeling of Reality</h1>
		<p>
			Science builds models to explain an aspect of reality. Most models are only accurate within a range of conditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Newtonian physics is a model that explains how things move, but it isn't a perfect description of reality.
			Relativistic physics is a more accurate model of reality near the speed of light, and quantum mechanics is more accurate for very short distances.
			No current scientific model can describe our universe perfectly.
