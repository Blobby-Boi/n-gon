		<h1 class='underlined'>Conservation of Energy</h1>
		<p>Energy is conserved. This means it can't be reduced or increased, but as systems change, the energy changes form. Since
			total energy is always the same value, we can build an equation that sets the total energy at one time equal to the total
			energy at any other time.
		</p>
		<div class='definition'>
			Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can change forms.
			<h1>$$E_i=E_f$$</h1>
			\( E_i \) = initial energy[J]
			<br>\( E_f \) = final energy [J]
		</div>
		<p>This equation is bare bones right now. We need to change it for each situation. We should only include energy types that
			are changed. For now we can calculate three types of energy.</p>

		<li>If an object
			<strong>changes speed</strong>, include kinetic energy.</li>
		<li>If an object
			<strong>moves vertically</strong>, include gravitational potential energy.</li>
		<li>If a
			<strong>spring is compressed</strong>, include spring potential energy.</li>


		<p>For example, if a ball at rest starts high up and falls down, the conservation of energy equation should only include kinetic
			and gravitational energy.</p>
		$$K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f$$ $$\frac{1}{2}mu^2 + mgh_i = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mgh_f$$
		<p>We can often set some the initial or final energies to zero as well. Initial kinetic energy is zero because the ball starts
			at rest. Choosing the final height to be zero will set the final gravitational potential energy to zero.</p>
		$$mgh_i = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
		<p>Also, look for variables that show up in every term. In this case mass can be ignored by dividing everything by mass.</p>
		$$gh_i = \frac{1}{2}v^2$$

				As the ball in the simulation falls, energy transfers from gravitational to kinetic. As it rises, energy transfers from kinetic
				to gravitational.
				<p>Energy is conserved. This means that if we add up the total energy of a system it will always be the same value, unless
					some energy enters or leaves the system we are tracking.</p>
				<p>Turn friction on and observe what happens.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The kinetic energy gradually leaves the ball as it changes into a type of energy called heat.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Heat</strong> is the random motion of particles. More heat leads to higher temperatures.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>So the internal energy of a system is always conserved, unless energy enters or leaves our system.</p>
		<div class='definition'>
			<p>The
				<strong>first law of thermodynamics</strong> says that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to heat flow into a
				system plus work done on a system.</p>
			<h1>$$\Delta U = Q + W$$</h1>
			\( U \) = total internal energy of a system [J]
			<br>\( Q \) = Heat, thermal energy added(+) or removed(-) from system [J]
			<br>\( W \) = work done on a system [J]
		</div>

		<div class='example'>
			<b>Example:</b> Compressing a volume of gas does 100 J of work, but at the same time the gas
			<strong>losses</strong> 200 J of heat to the surroundings. What is the change in the internal energy of the gas? Will the gas
			increase of decrease in temperature?
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				$$\Delta U = Q + W$$ $$\Delta U = -200 + 100$$ $$\Delta U = -100\,\mathrm{J}$$ $$\text{The gas will decrease in temperature}$$
			</details>
		</div>

		<b>Example:</b> A 0.43 kg soccer ball kicked at 10 m/s rolls down a 30 m tall hill. We already solved this problem and got
		a final velocity of 26.2 m/s for the ball.
		<br>
		<br>When actually performing the experiment we found at the bottom of the hill the ball only has a speed of 20.0m/s. Calculate
		the energy loss for the ball. How could the ball have lost energy?
		<details>
			<summary>solution</summary>
			<p>Find the difference between the experimental kinetic energy and the calculated kinetic energy.</p>
			$$\Delta KE = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}mv^{2}$$ $$\Delta KE = \tfrac{1}{2}(0.43)(26.2)^{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}(0.43)(20.0)^{2}$$
			$$\Delta KE = 147.6 - 86$$ $$\Delta KE = 61.6 \, \mathrm{J}$$ $$\text{The energy loss was probably from friction.}$$
