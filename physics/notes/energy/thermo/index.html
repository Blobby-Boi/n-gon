		<p>Thermodynamics looks for patterns in the statistical behavior of a very very large number of particles. A group of
			particles are called a <strong>system</strong>. Systems have measurable properties like temperature, pressure,
			volume, density, and entropy.</p>
		<p>It is easy to say that since thermodynamics is statistical it isn't always true. This is correct, but
			thermodynamic predictions
			become more accurate with more particles. A typical room has roughly $$\small
			1\,000\,000\,000\,000\,000\,000\,000\,000\,000=
			10^{27}$$ atoms of air.
		</p>
		<h1 class='underlined'>Temperature</h1>
		<p>Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy in a system of particles. Kinetic energy can be stored in
			spin,
			vibrations between particles, and normal movement.</p>

		<p><strong>Heat</strong> is energy leaving a system. A system doesn't "have" heat, it has internal energy, which is
			called heat only as it exits the system. </p>

		<p>
			When two systems with different temperatures are put in contact they will exchange heat until they reach the same
			temperature. Heat flows from high temperature systems into low temperature systems.

				As the ball in the simulation falls, energy transfers from gravitational to kinetic. As it rises, energy transfers
				from kinetic
				to gravitational.
				<p>Energy is conserved. This means that if we add up the total energy of a system it will always be the same value,
					unless
					some energy enters or leaves the system we are tracking.</p>
				<p>Turn friction on and observe what happens.</p>

				<p>The kinetic energy gradually leaves the ball. We describe energy that leaves a system as <strong>heat</strong>.
					Heat can leave in many forms, often heat leaves a system as thermal energy. Thermal energy is the kinetic energy
					of many particles at a microscopic scale.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>So the internal energy of a system is always <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b8ZsFszE8I">conserved</a>,
			unless energy leaves or enters. Energy can leave or enter as work or heat.</p>
		<div class='definition'>
			<p>The
				<strong>first law of thermodynamics</strong> says that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to heat
				flow into a
				system plus work done by the system.</p>
			<h1>$$\Delta E = Q - W$$</h1>
			\( E \) = total internal energy of a system [J]
			<br>\( Q \) = Heat, thermal energy added(+) or removed(-) from system [J]
			<br>\( W \) = work done by a system [J]
		</div>
		<p>
			We can add the concepts of heat and work to our conservation of energy equations to keep track of energy entering
			and leaving a system. Q or W added to the final side means that energy has left the system. Q or W on the
			initial side represents energy added to the system.
		</p>
		$$K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f + Q_f$$

			<strong>Example:</strong> Compressing a volume of gas does 100 J of work, but at the same time the gas

		<h1 class='underlined' id="entropy">Entropy</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Entropy</strong> is hard to define because different fields use the term to describe slightly different
			ideas. The definitions
			of entropy are all loosely centered around disorder. A high entropy system of particles is not organized. A low
			entropy system is very orderly, but how do you measure order?
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, order is whatever you decide. Often order is defined as a concentration of temperature, pressure, volume, or
			density. Many of these concentrations are able to do
			<a href="../../energy/energy/index.html#work">work</a>. In the simulation below, the work we want done is rotating
			the rotor. What state of the system would make the
			rotor turn?
		</p>
		<p>
			Click the clear button to remove the particles. Click inside the simulation to add some particles. Try to place the
			particles in a state that will turn the rotor.
		</p>

		<p>
			The system is in high entropy when the particles are evenly spread out. If your system gets in this state, adjust
			the slider to power the rotor from an external power source. The spinning rotor lowers entropy and puts the system
			back in a state that can do work.
		</p>

		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy">Entropy</a> plays an important role in thermochemistry, heat
			transfer, and information theory.</p>

		<!-- <p>
			Entropy can be defined in many other ways. Entropy as dispersal of temperature is useful for understanding engines. If a
			system has high entropy, the temperature is the same throughout the system. A low entropy system might have a sections
			with very low or very high temperature. These pockets of temperature difference can be made to do work, like in a
			<a href="http://www.animatedengines.com/">combustion engine
			</a>.
		</p> -->
		<!-- <p>
			In chemical reactions, entropy is calculated as the ratio of energy to temperature. This give a prediction of free enrgy
			avoidable for a chemical reaction.
		</p> -->

		<!-- <p>
			In chemical reactions, entropy is defined as low before an irreversible reaction or when chemical equilibrium is unbalanced.
			Paper has low entropy before I burn it. After it's been burned, it has high entropy.
		</p> -->
		<!-- <p>
			Energy is required for power plants, cell phones, cars, life. Energy only produces work when a system is in a low entropy
			state as defined by each system. Low entropy for a car is gasoline. A human will not get work from gasoline, we need tacos.
		</p> -->

		<h1 class='underlined'>Arrow of Time</h1>
		<p>
			If you were to watch a video of the Earth orbiting the sun, it would be difficult to tell if the video was running
			forwards
			or backwards. Simple physical systems don't have a clear forwards or backwards.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you were to watch a glass of water fall off a table, it would be very clear the direction of time. This is
			because the
			entropy of the glass of water is rapidly increasing.
		</p>
		<p>
			The laws of physics are time reversible. Nature behaves the same moving forwards or backwards in time. The only
			exception is entropy.
		</p>
		<div class="definition">
			The <strong>second law of thermodynamics</strong> states that entropy of an isolated system doesn't decrease over
			time.
		</div>
		<p>
			The second law is true for all the different formulations of entropy. As time moves forward entropy either increases
			or stays the same. Over time things spread out and move towards a balanced equilibrium. These high entropy states
			have less ability to do work.
		</p>
		<p>
			A human body as a thermodynamic system keeps it's ability to do work by adding low entropy substances, like food,
			oxygen, and water. We also lower our entropy by releasing high entropy substances, like carbon dioxide, urine, and
			feces.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Earth can be viewed as a thermodynamic system. As time goes on the energy density of Earth spreads out and loses
			the ability to do work. But the Earth isn't isolated. Low entropy light from the sun is added to our system and
			lowers our entropy. High entropy infrared light exits our system as the Earth cools.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inside the Sun, nuclear fusion converts hydrogen into helium and heat. Heat in the form of light strikes the Earth.
			Sunlight is a low entropy source that is harnessed by plants to produce work. We are able to order our world because
			the system of Earth is able to get work out of sunlight.
