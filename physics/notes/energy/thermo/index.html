				As the ball in the simulation falls, energy transfers from gravitational to kinetic. As it rises, energy transfers from kinetic
				to gravitational.
				<p>Energy is conserved. This means that if we add up the total energy of a system it will always be the same value, unless
					some energy enters or leaves the system we are tracking.</p>
				<p>Turn friction on and observe what happens.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The kinetic energy gradually leaves the ball as it changes into a type of energy called heat.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Heat</strong> is the random motion of particles. More heat leads to higher temperatures.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>So the internal energy of a system is always conserved, unless energy enters or leaves our system.</p>
		<div class='definition'>
			<p>The
				<strong>first law of thermodynamics</strong> says that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to heat flow into a
				system plus work done by the system.</p>
			<h1>$$\Delta U = Q - W$$</h1>
			\( U \) = total internal energy of a system [J]
			<br>\( Q \) = Heat, thermal energy added(+) or removed(-) from system [J]
			<br>\( W \) = work done by a system [J]
		</div>

		<div class='example'>
			<b>Example:</b> Compressing a volume of gas does 100 J of work, but at the same time the gas
			<strong>losses</strong> 200 J of heat to the surroundings. What is the change in the internal energy of the gas? Will the gas
			increase of decrease in temperature?
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				$$\Delta U = Q - W$$ $$\Delta U = -200 - 100$$ $$\Delta U = -300\,\mathrm{J}$$ $$\text{The gas will decrease in temperature}$$
			</details>
		</div>

		<b>Example:</b> A 0.43 kg soccer ball kicked at 10 m/s rolls down a 30 m tall hill. We already solved this problem and got
		a final velocity of 26.2 m/s for the ball.
		<br>
		<br>When actually performing the experiment we found at the bottom of the hill the ball only has a speed of 20.0m/s. Calculate
		the energy loss for the ball. How could the ball have lost energy?
		<details>
			<summary>solution</summary>
			<p>Find the difference between the experimental kinetic energy and the calculated kinetic energy.</p>
			$$\Delta KE = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}mv^{2}$$ $$\Delta KE = \tfrac{1}{2}(0.43)(26.2)^{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}(0.43)(20.0)^{2}$$
			$$\Delta KE = 147.6 - 86$$ $$\Delta KE = 61.6 \, \mathrm{J}$$ $$\text{The energy loss was probably from friction.}$$

		<h1 class='underlined'>Entropy</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Entropy</strong> is hard to define. Several fields use the term to describe slightly different ideas. The different definitions
			of entropy are all loosely centered around the idea that entropy measures disorder. A high entropy system of particles
			is not organized. A low entropy system is very orderly. But how do you measure order?
		</p>

		<canvas class='center' id='entropy1' height='300' width='600' onclick="entropy(this)"> </canvas>

		<p>
			Entropy can also be thought of as the dispersal of temperature in a system. If a system is in equilibrium then entropy is
			high and the temperature is the same throughout the system. A low entropy system might have a section with very low or
			very high temperature. These pockets of temperature difference can be made to do work, like in a combustion engine.
		</p>


		<h1 class='underlined'>Arrow of Time</h1>
		<p>All the equations of physics are reversible. The fundamental laws of Nature don't see time as moving forwards or backwards.
			The only exception is entropy. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy of an isolated system doesn't decrease
			over time.
		</p>
		<p>Examples:</p>

		<p>
			At the start of time entropy was very low. As time moves forward entropy increases. This means there is less entropy available
			to do work.
		</p>
		<p>Stars convert low entropy hydrogen into higher entropy Helium and heat. As the heat from the sun strikes the Earth it lowers
			the Earth's entropy because it creates energy density differences. Those energy differences are harnessed by plants, and
			weather patterns, and solar panels to produce work.</p>
