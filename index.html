        <p>
            <strong>Physics is science.</strong> One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, physics investigates how matter
            and energy change over space and time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Physics advances technology.</strong> Physics is behind all the different technologies in a cell phone. Physics
            explains how electromagnetic waves encode information between a cell phone and tower, how electricity in the
            computer chips is controlled by transistors, resistors, and other elements, how a phone's speaker produces changing
            waves of air pressure, and how a phone uses GPS to know its position.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Physics guides engineering.</strong> A knowledge of physics allows engineers to predict how reality behaves,
            which helps them design, tinker, and experiment
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Physics speaks with math.</strong> Math is the language physics uses to predict and communicate the nature of
            our universe.

        <h1 class='underlined'>About Me</h1>
        <p>I graduated from University of Georgia with a B.S. in physics and astronomy. After college I moved to Los Angeles
            and got credentialed to teach high school physics and chemistry. Iâ€™ve been teaching physics, chemistry, and computer
            programming in California since 2006. Before joining New West I was both the dean of students and chemistry teacher
            at SLO Classical Academy.</p>
        <p>I nerd out on: books, hiking, soccer, science, coding, electronics</p>
