*****************************************************

mouse can get suck as clicked if the user clicks off the window
  can lead to gun lock up until player pressed mouse again
  should I really need to fix this?

diegetic field meter
  show as the player head filling with teal color

atmosphere levels
  large rotating fan that the player has to move through
  give the user a rest, between combat
  low combat
    nonaggressive mobs
      one mob attacking the passive mobs
  more graphics
  
Boss levels
  boss grows and spilt, if you don't kill it fast
    sensor that locks you in after you enter the boss room
  boss that eats other mobs and gains stats from them
    chance to spawn on any level (past level 5)
  boss that knows how to shoot (player) bullets that collide with player 
    overwrite custom engine collision bullet mob function.

add a key that player picks up and needs to set on the exit door to open it

add modular difficulty settings
  take reduced dmg
  slower mob look / CD
  more drops
  fewer mobs
    make a new var to scale number of mobs and stop using levels cleared var

make power ups keep moving to player if the pickup field is turned off before they get picked up
  not sure how to do this without adding a constant check

levels spawn by having the map aspects randomly fly into place

new map with repeating endlessness
  get ideas from Manifold Garden game
  if falling, get teleported above the map
    I tried it, but had trouble getting the camera to adjust to the teleportation
    this can apply to blocks mobs, and power ups as well
    
field power up effects
  field allows player to hold and throw living mobs

mod power ups ideas
  double jump
  bullet on mob damage effects
    add to the array mob.do new mob behaviors
        add a damage over time
        add a freeze

give mobs more animal-like behaviors
  like rainworld
  give mobs something to do when they don't see player
    explore map
    eat power ups
      drop power up (if killed after eating one)
  mobs some times aren't aggressive
    when low on life or after taking a large hit
  mobs can fight each other
    this might be hard to code
  isolated mobs try to group up.
    
game mechanics
  mechanics that support the physics engine
    add rope/constraint
  get ideas from game: limbo / inside
  environmental hazards
    laser
    lava
  button / switch
  door
  fizzler
  moving platform
  map zones
    water
    low friction ground
    bouncy ground
