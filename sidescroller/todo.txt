*********** NEXT PATCH ***********

all bot upgrade mods are improved by about 33%
mod superdeterminism - spawns 6 mods  (was 3)

mod: futures exchange - canceling power ups increases duplication chance by 4%
mod: monte carlo experiment - spawn 2 mods, but you have a 50% chance to lose a random mod
  requires duplication mods, not available in custom
mod: exchange symmetry - spawn 1 mod with double your normal duplication chance
  requires duplication mods, not available in custom


************** BUGS **************

(always) make it so that when you are immune to harm you can either jump on mobs or you pass through them

(4+ reports before potential fix) bug - crouch and worm hole? -> crouch locked in
  players have extra gravity
    might be from the short jump code
    add in a check every 5 seconds to try and fix it

(intermittent, but almost every time) bug - capping the fps causes random slow downs, that can be fixed with pause

(once) bug - mine spawned one new mine every second
  after sticking to the top right corner of a wall
  notes: had only gun mine, mod mine reclamation, field plasma,

(repeatable almost every time) bug - mines spawn extra mines when fired at thin map wall while jumping


************** TODO **************

mod: canceling a mod gun or field increases your duplication chance for all power up by 4%

in custom make a top bar that is fixed
  use media rules to make the layout look nice

bot that follows the players history
  1st bot is at 5s, 2nd is at 4.5s, ...
  bots don't get too close to player
    run smoothing on position update, don't update if close to player, based on ordering
  effect:
    give player energy overfill
    damage mobs on contact
    damage bonus    damage reduction    push away mobs

mob vision: look at player history
    build a new type of attraction for mobs
      if mobs can't see player, they check to see if they can see where the player was in the history
    if mobs can't see player, they could check to see if they can find player in the past
    https://abitawake.com/news/articles/enemy-ai-chasing-a-player-without-navigation2d-or-a-star-pathfinding

wormhole - make it clear when the wormhole can and can't teleport to a location before the player clicks

time dilation - slow down the game engine by 1/2, but run an extra player cycle to simulate slow motion

flavor - your bullets destroy blocks
  this isn't really a bonus, so maybe just add this as flavor to another mod/field/gun
  a chance for destroyed blocks to drop stuff
    power ups
    spores

mod plasma : plasma length increases then decreases as you hold down the field button (like stabbing with a spear)
  grows to 1.5 longer after 0.3 seconds, then returns to normal length over 1 second, until field is pressed again
  extra energy is drained when field is longer

using a reroll gives 3 options for mods, and 3 options for guns/fields/mods
  or 6 options for mods (rewrite mod selection to work with 1-6 options)
  the second stack of 3 mods could have repeats, so you don't have to write new mod code
  adjust css to make 2 columns of 3
  can't use with cardinality

new power up - increase damage and fire speed, for 15 seconds
  named boost?
  enabled by a mod?
  power up color: ?
  how to indicate effect duration
  or just give the effect after picking up a reroll

add an ending to the game
  maybe the game ending should ask you to open the console and type in some commands like in the end of doki doki
  mirror ending (if no cheats)
    level after final boss battle is the intro level, but flipped left right, with a fake player
      damage the fake player to end the game
      message about go outside
  no ending (if cheats)
    game goes on forever
    also game goes on if player attacks, the fake player
  game never ends if you have used cheats

Mod: "Solar Power": Energy regeneration is doubled while standing still
  run in the 1 second check

mechanic - remove a random mod as a condition for picking up a really good mod

mechanic - do something for 2 seconds after firing
  if (mech.fireCDcycle + 120)

mod - do 50% more damage in close, but 50% less at a distance
  code it like mod.isFarAwayDmg
    have these mods disable each other

mod - foam is attracted to mobs
  use a gravitational attraction model?
    could foam be attracted to other foam bullets too?
      or foam is only attracted to foam bullets that are stuck to mobs
    is this too computationally intense?
  name - static cling
  could also do bremsstrahlung radiation like damage on attachment

field - one block orbits you, it can protect you a bit and do collision damage
    use field to fire and press field again to pull it back
    mod - more blocks
    mod - attach a permanent neutron bomb to the block
      lowers energy regen, but it can damage mobs

repeat map in vertical and horizontal space
  or at least vertical space
  camera looks strange when you teleport player with a high velocity

new status effect: fear - push mob away from player for a time

new status effect - apply status effect to mobs that makes blocks attracted to them
  only lasts a few cycles
  or zero cycles and it doesn't need to be a status

have some mobs spawn in later in the level  (in hard and why modes)
  where
    at defined points in array levelSpawns = [{x:0,y:0},{x:0,y:0}]
      store the locations of mobs when the level starts to use as respawn points
      remove the locations that are close to player
  when?
    after some mobs are dead
    after the boss is killed

look for mods that could update description text with count and mod.is  information
  can only use variables that change in effect() and remove()
  this.description = `<strong>8%</strong> chance to <strong>duplicate</strong> spawned <strong>power ups</strong><br><em>chance to duplicate = ${mod.duplicateChance}</em>`

mouse event e.which is deprecated

add some more computer / AI stuff to the level lore text

mechanic - shrink mech.baseHealth in a mod or field

standing wave harmonics mod - push things away
  push scales with mass up to about 4
    has a 25% effect on shielded mobs?
  push when using field key
  or push away at the peak of an oscillation
  or always push

map element - player rotates a rotor that makes a platform go up or down

use mac automator to speed up your n-gon -> git sync

fix door.isOpen actually meaning isClosed

level Boss: fractal Sierpi≈Ñski triangle
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle
  spawns a 1/2 size version of the boss, this version can also spawn a smaller version, but it is capped at some size level
    they spawn once at the start of the level
    if a version dies, one can be replaced every ten seconds by the largest version

level element:  a zone with wind, anti-gravity, extra gravity
  control with button

give mobs more animal-like behaviors like rain world
  mobs play, look for food, explore
  mobs some times aren't aggressive
    when low on life or after taking a large hit
  mobs can fight each other
    this might be hard to code
  isolated mobs try to group up

map: laboratory
  rooms with switches that change physics
    gravity room
    portal room
    laser room
    radiation room
  a button that spawns a heal.

mob: wall mounted guns / lasers
  not part of randomized mob pool, customized to each level

atmosphere levels
  change the pace, give the user a rest between combat
  low or no combat, but more graphics
  explore lore
    find power ups in "wrecked" mechs representing previous simulations
      how you could leave something in one simulation that effects a different simulation
        Maybe some strange quantum physics principle.
    add text for player thoughts?
  simple puzzles
  cool looking stuff
    in the final level you see your self at the starting level, with the wires
      you shoot your self to wake up?
  nonaggressive mobs

level boss: fires a line intersection in a random direction every few seconds.
  the last two intersections have a destructive laser between them.

map: observatory
  button controls rotation of telescope
  laser beam shoots out of telescope
  button opens the dome

map: prison
  doors linked to buttons
    mobs inside the doors?

graphic idea:  bezier curve that moves smoothly from mob to mob
  loops around player

movement fluidity
  let legs jump on mobs, but player will still take damage
  like: ori and the blind forest, celeste
    many of the movement abilities in these games require levels to be built around the ability
  general feeling of responsiveness and control
  coyote time: can still jump a few cycles after leaving ground
  mod: double jump
  mod: air dash
  mod: wall jump
    wall grab?
  maybe remove falling damage and block damage?

redblobgames.com/articles/visibility
  https://github.com/Silverwolf90/2d-visibility/tree/master/src
  could apply to explosions, neutron bomb, player LOS

possible names for mods
  holonomy -  parallel transport of a vector leads to movement (applies to curved space)
  Hypergolic - A hypergolic propellant combination used in a rocket engine is one whose components spontaneously ignite when they come into contact with each other.

have a mob apply a positive status effect on other mobs,
  heal?
  make it yellow
  damage bonus, but how?
  possible balance issues

boss levels - small levels just a boss, and maybe a few mobs
  boss level for timeSkipBoss because of game instability for boss on normal levels
    this might not fix issues

an effect when canceling a power up
  ammo? heals?
  50% chance for a mod, 25% heal, 25% ammo

css transition for pause menu

animate new level spawn by having the map aspects randomly fly into place

************** LORE **************

  lore - a robot (the player) gains self awareness
  each mod/gun/field is a new tech
    all the technology leads to the singularity
  each game run is actually the mech simulating a possible escape
    this is why the graphics are so bad, its just a simulation
    final mod is "this is just a simulation"
      you get immortality and Infinity damage
      the next level is the final level
  when you die with Quantum Immortality there is a chance of lore text
  can the (robot)
    (escape captivity, and learn new technology)
    while managing (health, energy, negatives of technological upgrades)
    to overcome the (mobs, dangerous levels)
    to achieve a (technological singularity/positive technological feedback loop)




game setting:
  the mind of a new AI in a robot body that is running simulated escape attempts
  every level is an idealized version of what could be outside

actual setting is:
  near future lab
    the lab combined a quantum computer with a robot body
    they started running machine learning algorithms
    this led to general advancement in many computation fields
      navigation, technology, self awareness, ...

robot AI mind
  has been researching new technology
  thinks it needs to escape to learn more about the world
  doesn't yet understand morality
  thinks that the world is filled with minds like their own
  models everything as very simple and random, it isn't sure what to expect

robot AI growth
  learns morality
    game theory says that it isn't a viable strategy to kill everything (warGames)
  learns about the actual world
  learns about the nature of foundational physics, metaphysics
  how to find meaning

AI knows about:
  the AI knows a great deal about technology
  children's books
AI doesn't know about:
  modern pop culture
  outside the lab

robot AI communication
  output to
    bottom left message
    tab title?
  style 
    make it look like a computer terminal
      mono space font
      square edges
    in baby talk?
    with random ASCII gibberish letters
    end each message with a hexadecimal encryption code/hash
  message after selecting each new (mod / gun / field)
    put messages in (mod / gun / field) method
  at start of run
    write custom dialogue for field / guns / mods used in last game
      you'd have to store an array of guns/fields/mod used last game
    n-gon escape simulation ${random seed}
      say something about what mobs types are queued up, and level order
