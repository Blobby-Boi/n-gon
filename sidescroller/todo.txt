*********** NEXT PATCH ***********
you can view the patch notes for the last few commits from the game menu
  this uses the github API, so it might have some delay

overfill mods add energy instead of setting energy to a value 

bug - blocks in vertical portals can get stuck inside the portals
  fixed, but only for one portal... oh well

mobs that make a scrap bot, don't leave a block body anymore

************** BUGS **************

bug - crouch and worm hole? -> crouch locked in
bug - getting locked into crouch on community levels, but showing the player as still standing

bug - capping the fps causes random slow downs, that can be fixed with pause

bug - mine spawned one new mine every second
  after sticking to the top right corner of a wall
  notes: had only gun mine, mod mine reclamation, field plasma,
bug - mines spawn extra mines when fired at thin map wall while jumping

************** MODS **************

mod - neutron bomb needs a method to "catch" mobs in it's field
  apply stun status effect
  too similar to the stun effect?

mod - nano scale field could be a mod
  excess energy is converted to bullets
    run this code in the energy overfill code check
  possible issues
    worm hole, Penrose process - nerf a bit
    pair production - nerf and give it to anyone
    cloaking field - maybe just don't spawn bullets when cloaked

mod - sentry fires other bullet types
  laser or missile

flak could be a mod for shotgun?

mod - self destruct - drones explode when they die
  drones lose extra time on collisions, so they often explode after a collision

mod - a bot that eats up health and ammo, but poops out a mod (10 power ups = 1 mod?)
  or it poops a reroll after picking up 2 heal/ammo
    requires the reroll -> bot mod
    4 rerolls can convert to a bot,  also 1 rerolls can convert to 5% damage
    the mods that do those effects could be required before you see this bot
  it passes through walls
  moves slower then the player so you can get to it before the bot if you hurry
  disable crystalized armor?

mod - rerolls give at least 1 mod that applies your field and gun if possible
  give fields and guns a tag
  also spawn a few rerolls for balance?

mod: take less harm if you are in the air
  require squirrel cage rotor

mod - explosions apply radiation damage over time
  or spawn a neutron bomb with a short timer

mod - remove a random mod as a condition for picking up a really good mod

mod - double the player's time rate (like you do with the time dilation mod)

mod - do something for 2 seconds after firing
  if (mech.fireCDcycle + 120)

mod - do 50% more damage in close, but 50% less at a distance
  code it like mod.isFarAwayDmg
    have these mods disable each other

mod - bot very slowly follows you and gives you a bonus when it's in range
  it moves through walls
  effect: damage bonus?, damage reduction?, push away mobs, limit top speed of mobs/blocks/player?

mod - foam is attracted to mobs
  use a gravitational attraction model?
    could foam be attracted to other foam bullets too?
      or foam is only attracted to foam bullets that are stuck to mobs
    is this too computationally intense?
  name - static cling
  could also do bremsstrahlung radiation like damage on attachment

************** TODO **************

wormholes need to give feedback on where a portal can go
  or automatically put portals in safe places

field - You have a permanent neutron bomb oscillating on you. Energy regeneration and heal powerup effectiveness is halved.
  neutron field could be a passive outwards push, replacing the defined, oscillating border of SWH with a less powerful, larger border

find a way to automatically show patch information from github on n-gon main page

repeat map in vertical and horizontal space
  or at least vertical space
  camera looks strange when you teleport player with a high velocity

sucker mobs do something when they touch blocks
  heal
  remove the blocks from the map

add an ending to the game
  maybe the game ending should ask you to open the console and type in some commands like in the end of doki doki
  mirror ending (if no cheats)
    level after final boss battle is the intro level, but flipped left right, with a fake player
      damage the fake player to end the game
      message about go outside
  no ending (if cheats)
    game goes on forever
    also game goes on if player attacks, the fake player
  game never ends if you have used cheats

new status effect: fear - push mob away from player for a time

new status effect - apply status effect to mobs that makes blocks attracted to them
  only lasts a few cycles

have some mobs spawn in later in the level  (in hard and why modes)
  where
    at defined points in array levelSpawns = [{x:0,y:0},{x:0,y:0}]
      store the locations of mobs when the level starts to use as respawn points
      remove the locations that are close to player
  when?
    after some mobs are dead
    after the boss is killed

look for mods that could update description text with count and mod.is  information
  can only use variables that change in effect() and remove()
  this.description = `<strong>8%</strong> chance to <strong>duplicate</strong> spawned <strong>power ups</strong><br><em>chance to duplicate = ${mod.duplicateChance}</em>`

mouse event e.which is deprecated

add a flag to some bullets to indicate that mobs can't learn the player position from bullet damage in bullet-mob collisions
  if isNotRevealPlayerLocation flag is true have the mob still know player location if nearby player
  on hide if bullet age is above 4 seconds?
  spores
  mines
  conditions to reveal player from damage?
    1. bullet spawned from player
    2. bullet is less than 4 seconds old
    3. damage is nearby player or in line of sight of player

add some more computer / AI stuff to the level lore text

general idea: shrink mech.baseHealth in a mod or field

change player color based on harm reduction

standing wave harmonics mod - push things away
  push scales with mass up to about 4
    has a 25% effect on shielded mobs?
  push when using field key
  or push away at the peak of an oscillation
  or always push

map element - player rotates a rotor that makes a platform go up or down

use mac automator to speed up your n-gon -> git sync

fix door.isOpen actually meaning isClosed

level Boss: fractal Sierpi≈Ñski triangle
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle
  spawns a 1/2 size version of the boss, this version can also spawn a smaller version, but it is capped at some size level
    they spawn once at the start of the level
    if a version dies, one can be replaced every ten seconds by the largest version

level element:  a zone with wind, anti-gravity, extra gravity
  control with button

give mobs more animal-like behaviors like rain world
  mobs play, look for food, explore
  mobs some times aren't aggressive
    when low on life or after taking a large hit
  mobs can fight each other
    this might be hard to code
  isolated mobs try to group up

map: laboratory
  rooms with switches that change physics
    gravity room
    portal room
    laser room
    radiation room
  a button that spawns a heal.

mob: wall mounted guns / lasers
  not part of randomized mob pool, customized to each level

atmosphere levels
  change the pace, give the user a rest between combat
  low or no combat, but more graphics
  explore lore
    find power ups in "wrecked" mechs representing previous simulations
      how you could leave something in one simulation that effects a different simulation
        Maybe some strange quantum physics principle.
    add text for player thoughts?
  simple puzzles
  cool looking stuff
    in the final level you see your self at the starting level, with the wires
      you shoot your self to wake up?
  nonaggressive mobs

lore - a robot (the player) gains self awareness
  each mod/gun/field is a new tech
    all the technology leads to the singularity
  each game run is actually the mech simulating a possible escape
    this is why the graphics are so bad, its just a simulation
    final mod is "this is just a simulation"
      you get immortality and Infinity damage
      the next level is the final level
  when you die with Quantum Immortality there is a chance of lore text
  can the (robot)
    (escape captivity, and learn new technology)
    while managing (health, energy, negatives of technological upgrades)
    to overcome the (mobs, dangerous levels)
    to achieve a (technological singularity/positive technological feedback loop)

level boss: fires a line intersection in a random direction every few seconds.
  the last two intersections have a destructive laser between them.

map: observatory
  button controls rotation of telescope
  laser beam shoots out of telescope
  button opens the dome

map: prison
  doors linked to buttons
    mobs inside the doors?

graphic idea:  bezier curve that moves smoothly from mob to mob
  loops around player

movement fluidity
  let legs jump on mobs, but player will still take damage
  like: ori and the blind forest, celeste
    many of the movement abilities in these games require levels to be built around the ability
  general feeling of responsiveness and control
  coyote time: can still jump a few cycles after leaving ground
  mod: double jump
  mod: air dash
  mod: wall jump
    wall grab?
  maybe remove falling damage and block damage?

redblobgames.com/articles/visibility
  https://github.com/Silverwolf90/2d-visibility/tree/master/src
  could apply to explosions, neutron bomb, player LOS

possible names for mods
  holonomy -  parallel transport of a vector leads to movement (applies to curved space)
  Hypergolic - A hypergolic propellant combination used in a rocket engine is one whose components spontaneously ignite when they come into contact with each other.

have a mob apply a positive status effect on other mobs,
  heal?
  make it yellow
  damage bonus, but how?
  possible balance issues

boss levels - small levels just a boss, and maybe a few mobs
  boss level for timeSkipBoss because of game instability for boss on normal levels
    this might not fix issues

an effect when canceling a power up
  ammo? heals?
  50% chance for a mod, 25% heal, 25% ammo

add player Scent Trails for mob navigation
