mod - spores follow player
mod - nails do 66% extra damage over 6 seconds


************** TODO - n-gon **************

field - pilot wave
  while mouse is down blocks (and mobs?) are move with the mouse
    players can do serious damage by flicking the mouse and firing blocks
    on mouse down calculate relative position of block to mouse and maintain that as mouse moves
      on mouse up give blocks the computed mouse velocity
    use a gravity effect that pulls blocks in range towards the center of the mouse
      maybe no force in the very center to prevent clumping
  draw a ellipse around the mouse that wobbles like phase decoherence field, and changes color maybe like negative mass field

make flurooantimonic acid mod a damage over time
  rename to radiation damage?

mod - radiation damage over time effects can spread to nearby mobs
  do a check for nearby mobs on each tick

try adding a subtile shift of color towards red, green or blue
  block, map, background, text? color
  could be random as each level loads

player health becomes NaN
occurred a few times at higher levels
  game.dmgScale, game.healScale not corrupted

  didn't occur:   shotgun / laser  with all mods that have no requirements

mod - killing a stunned mob gives something 
  ammo or heal power up?

mod - scale squirrel cage rotor with current energy
  is variable speed going to be hard to deal with?

boss level for timeSkipBoss because of game instability for boss on normal levels
  boss level needs to be very simple (maybe no other mobs, or no random mobs)

mod - you can no longer see your current health

boss mob - just a faster and larger version of a springer mob
  could have a more frequent random walk
  always shielded
  consider combining with time skipper field?

pulse and time dilation only upgrades left with no dedicated mod

mob - time skipper: sends a pulse wave out that will cause time to jump forward 1 second.

mob stabber - extends one vector like the shooter, but quickly in order to stab

mob sniper - targeting laser, then a high speed, no gravity bullet

mod - nails do poison damage

mod - increase laser bot range, and reduce energy drain

mod - mines become a turret that fires nails
  it could float to the mouse location on fire

mod - blocks stun mobs

settings - custom keys binding

lore - a robot (the player) gains self awareness
  each mod/gun/field is a new tech
    all the technology leads to the singularity
  each game run is actually the mech simulating a possible escape
    this is why the graphics are so bad, its just a simulation
    final mod is "this is just a simulation"
      you get immortality and Infinity damage
      the next level is the final level
  when you die with Quantum Immortality there is a chance of lore text

atmosphere levels: change the pace, give the user a rest between combat
  low or no combat, but more graphics
  explore lore
    find power ups in "wrecked" mechs representing previous simulations
      how you could leave something in one simulation that effects a different simulation
        Maybe some strange quantum physics principle.
    add text for player thoughts?
  simple puzzles
  cool looking stuff
    large rotating fan that the player has to move through
    nonaggressive mobs
    in the final level you see your self at the starting level, with the wires
      you shoot your self to wake up?

css transition for pause menu

mod - do extra damage based on your speed
  do more damage when not moving?
  take less damage when not moving?

gun/field: portals
  use the code from mines to get them to stick to walls
    or lasers
  alternate red and blue portals
  
weekly random challenge where everyone playing each week gets the same random setup.
  The randomness would be determined by the date so it would sync everyone.
  power ups still drop, but the drops are determined by a preset list that changes each week.

gun:  Spirit Bomb (singularity)
  use charge up like rail gun
  electricity graphics like plasma torch
  suck in nearby mobs, power ups?, blocks?
    sucked in stuff increase size
  uses energy
  hold above the player's head

small Boss levels
  sensor that locks you in after you enter the boss room
  boss that eats other mobs and gains stats from them
    chance to spawn on any level (past level 5)

add a key that player picks up and needs to set on the exit door to open it

make power ups keep moving to player if the pickup field is turned off before they get picked up
  not sure how to do this without adding a constant check

animate new level spawn by having the map aspects randomly fly into place
    
give mobs more animal-like behaviors
  like rain world
  give mobs something to do when they don't see player
    explore map
    eat power ups
      drop power up (if killed after eating one)
  mobs some times aren't aggressive
    when low on life or after taking a large hit
  mobs can fight each other
    this might be hard to code
  isolated mobs try to group up.
    
game mechanics
  mechanics that support the physics engine
    add rope/constraint
  get ideas from game: limbo / inside
  environmental hazards
    laser
    lava
  button / switch
  door
  fizzler
  moving platform
  map zones
    water
    low friction ground
    bouncy ground
