mod - many worlds: 100% chance on choosing a power up to spawn a reroll if you have no rerolls
mod - microstates: +7% damage for every 10 active bullets
  (requires mod: Lorentzian topology)
mod - laser diode: laser, pulse, and laser-bots use 37% less energy
25% increase in difficulty scaling  (level 10 should now have the difficulty of level 12)
  effects: player damage, mod damage, mob acceleration, mob reaction time, mob cooldown time

************** TODO - n-gon **************

rays can have width,  how to use this?
  Matter.Query.ray(bodies, startPoint, endPoint, [rayWidth])
  wide lasers?

bug - mines spawn extra mines when fired at thin map wall while jumping

mod - negative mass field move faster
  less friction, more like flying?

what about a neutron bomb mod, that causes the bomb to activate right after you fire and slowly move forward with no gravity

redblobgames.com/articles/visibility
  https://github.com/Silverwolf90/2d-visibility/tree/master/src
  could apply to explosions, neutron bomb, player LOS

bug - sticking bullets don't always gain the correct speed from mobs after they die

possible names for mods
  Hypergolic - A hypergolic propellant combination used in a rocket engine is one whose components spontaneously ignite when they come into contact with each other.

have a mob apply a positive status effect on other mobs,
  heal?
  make it yellow
  damage bonus, but how?
  possible balance issues

boss levels - small levels just a boss, and maybe a few mobs
  boss level for timeSkipBoss because of game instability for boss on normal levels
    this might not fix issues

atmosphere levels: change the pace, give the user a rest between combat
  low or no combat, but more graphics
  explore lore
    find power ups in "wrecked" mechs representing previous simulations
      how you could leave something in one simulation that effects a different simulation
        Maybe some strange quantum physics principle.
    add text for player thoughts?
  simple puzzles
  cool looking stuff
    large rotating fan that the player has to move through
    in the final level you see your self at the starting level, with the wires
      you shoot your self to wake up?
  nonaggressive mobs

lore - a robot (the player) gains self awareness
  each mod/gun/field is a new tech
    all the technology leads to the singularity
  each game run is actually the mech simulating a possible escape
    this is why the graphics are so bad, its just a simulation
    final mod is "this is just a simulation"
      you get immortality and Infinity damage
      the next level is the final level
  when you die with Quantum Immortality there is a chance of lore text

mob - stuns, or slows player 

boss mob - let it die multiple times and come back to life
  on death event spawns a new version of self, but with a decrementing counter

bullets cost 5 life instead of ammo, but return 5 life when they hit a mob
  replace life with energy or ammo?

an effect when canceling a power up
  ammo? heals?
  50% chance for a mod, 25% heal, 25% ammo

liquid nitrogen cooling
  Mobs freeze on contact with the player

uranium reactor core
  Mobs get irradiated on contact with the player

add player Scent Trails for mob navigation

mod - scale squirrel cage rotor with current energy
  is variable speed going to be hard to deal with?

mod - you can no longer see your current health

mod - increase laser bot range, and reduce energy drain

mod - mines become a turret that fires nails
  it could float to the mouse location on fire

mod - blocks stun mobs

settings - custom keys binding

css transition for pause menu

gun/field: portals
  use the code from mines to get them to stick to walls
    or lasers
  alternate red and blue portals
  
weekly random challenge where everyone playing each week gets the same random setup.
  The randomness would be determined by the date so it would sync everyone.
  power ups still drop, but the drops are determined by a preset list that changes each week.

gun:  Spirit Bomb (singularity)
  use charge up like rail gun
  electricity graphics like plasma torch
  suck in nearby mobs, power ups?, blocks?
    sucked in stuff increase size
  uses energy
  hold above the player's head

add a key that player picks up and needs to set on the exit door to open it

make power ups keep moving to player if the pickup field is turned off before they get picked up
  not sure how to do this without adding a constant check

animate new level spawn by having the map aspects randomly fly into place
    
give mobs more animal-like behaviors
  like rain world
  give mobs something to do when they don't see player
    explore map
    eat power ups
      drop power up (if killed after eating one)
  mobs some times aren't aggressive
    when low on life or after taking a large hit
  mobs can fight each other
    this might be hard to code
  isolated mobs try to group up.
    
game mechanics
  mechanics that support the physics engine
    add rope/constraint
  get ideas from game: limbo / inside
  environmental hazards
    laser
    lava
  button / switch
  door
  fizzler
  moving platform
  map zones
    water
    low friction ground
    bouncy ground
