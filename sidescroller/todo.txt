shotgun hits harder up close and weaker far away 
swarm is now called ice IX and it freezes mobs
mod - ablative mines
acid and negative feedback now tell you when they are active


************** TODO - n-gon **************

MOB stabber - extends one vector like the shooter, but quickly in order to stab

mod - frag grenades fire nails on explosion

mod - drop a mine after taking damage

work on burn status effect
  graphics don't look right
  how is it different from the chemical dot

perfect diamagnetism should get larger as it blocks more, and then slowly fade back to the normal size

gun - bullets that acts like drones but only last for 2 seconds and do more damage

field - the basic field emitter, but no energy loss and no knock back on blocks
  this field should make blocking a viable strategy
  gain energy on blocking?
  call it diamagnetic field and remove the diamagnetism mod?

mod - nails do poison damage
mod - increase laser bot range, and reduce energy drain

mod - mines become a turret that fires nails
  it could float to the mouse location on fire

dash - mod  when pressing left or right on the ground, teleport to the right until you find an obstruction
  do repeated horizontal zone queries until they hit map or block
  up to a max range of like 10 player widths
  this didn't work as a field, but maybe as a gun?

mod - blocks stun mobs
mod or field - turn blocks into spores or drones

mod - robot that attack nearby mobs, and delivers a stun status effect
  use laser bot code for the attack
  large and 5 sided?

bug - getting stuck in crouch mode
  press T to see it visually
  happened twice to me so far
    once right after selecting a mod with lots of blocks around
      I don't think I was holding a block
      might have been standing on a block... not sure
  running mech.definePlayerMass()  fixes it

settings - auto aim at nearest mob
settings - custom keys binding

gun - buff vacuum bomb
  it's weak late game
    can't spam it faster
    bad vs. shields
    doesn't scale up to huge groups
  buff collision damage?
  mod - double explosions?
  mod - doesn't suck player in?
  mod - DoT damage after exploding

mod - energy recharges faster when not moving

lore - a robot (the player) gains self awareness
  each mod/gun/field is a new tech
    all the technology leads to the singularity
  each game run is actually the mech simulating a possible escape
    this is why the graphics are so bad, its just a simulation
    final mod is "this is just a simulation"
      you get immortality and Infinity damage
      the next level is the final level
  when you die with Quantum Immortality there is a chance of lore text

atmosphere levels: change the pace, give the user a rest between combat
  low or no combat, but more graphics
  explore lore
    find power ups in "wrecked" mechs representing previous simulations
      how you could leave something in one simulation that effects a different simulation
        Maybe some strange quantum physics principle.
    add text for player thoughts?
  simple puzzles
  cool looking stuff
    large rotating fan that the player has to move through
    nonaggressive mobs
    in the final level you see your self at the starting level, with the wires
      you shoot your self to wake up?

MOB sniper - targeting laser, then a high speed, no gravity bullet

mod - status effects last 1 second longer
  wait until you have more status effects written

mod - time dilation - Quantum Recovery
  Expending all your energy while using the field will
    cause the player to go back in time to 3 seconds before the field was activated
      resets ammo?, health, position, velocity
      need to track player info in game.checks() in an array
        put the array in the time field object
    cause the player to go back in time when the field was first activated (easier then going back to 3 seconds before)

css transition for pause menu

field that pushes everything back, and can destroy smaller blocks
  converts blocks into ammo power ups

mod: bot that fires minigun bullets
  only fires when your mouse is held down

mod: do extra damage based on your speed
  do more damage when not moving?
  take less damage when not moving?

gun/field: portals
  use the code from mines to get them to stick to walls
    or lasers
  alternate red and blue portals
  
missiles don't explode reliably enough
  they can bounce, which is cool, but they should still explode right after a bounce

weekly random challenge where everyone playing each week gets the same random setup.
  The randomness would be determined by the date so it would sync everyone.
  power ups still drop, but the drops are determined by a preset list that changes each week.

mod: do something at the end of each level
  heal to full
    should still be effected by the heal reduction at higher difficulty
  give ammo to current gun
  give goals/quests for each level
    how to track goals?
    take no damage
    don't shoot

gun:  Spirit Bomb (singularity)
  use charge up like rail gun
  electricity graphics like plasma torch
  suck in nearby mobs, power ups?, blocks?
    sucked in stuff increase size
  uses energy
  hold above the player's head

Boss levels
  sensor that locks you in after you enter the boss room
  boss that eats other mobs and gains stats from them
    chance to spawn on any level (past level 5)

add a key that player picks up and needs to set on the exit door to open it

make power ups keep moving to player if the pickup field is turned off before they get picked up
  not sure how to do this without adding a constant check

animate new level spawn by having the map aspects randomly fly into place

new map with repeating endlessness
  get ideas from Manifold Garden game
  if falling, get teleported above the map
    I tried it, but had trouble getting the camera to adjust to the teleportation
    this can apply to blocks mobs, and power ups as well
    
give mobs more animal-like behaviors
  like rain world
  give mobs something to do when they don't see player
    explore map
    eat power ups
      drop power up (if killed after eating one)
  mobs some times aren't aggressive
    when low on life or after taking a large hit
  mobs can fight each other
    this might be hard to code
  isolated mobs try to group up.
    
game mechanics
  mechanics that support the physics engine
    add rope/constraint
  get ideas from game: limbo / inside
  environmental hazards
    laser
    lava
  button / switch
  door
  fizzler
  moving platform
  map zones
    water
    low friction ground
    bouncy ground
