************** TODO - n-gon **************

pulse and time dilation only ones left with no dedicated mod

lore - a robot (the player) gains self awareness
  each mod/gun/field is a new tech
    all the technology leads to the singularity
  each game run is actually the mech simulating a possible escape
    this is why the graphics are so bad, its just a simulation
    final mod is "this is just a simulation"
      you get immortality and Infinity damage
      the next level is the final level
  when you die with Quantum Immortality there is a chance of lore text
  make a global variable that goes up by one every time you play
    show text at start, loading simulation #...

mod - status effects last 1 second longer
  cryonics : a mod that increases the freezing time of mobs.
  wait until you have more status effects written

mob Boss - time skipper: sends a pulse wave out that will cause time to jump forward 1 second.
  what about a series of short time skips forward 10 cycles at a time

MOB stabber - extends one vector like the shooter, but quickly in order to stab

work on burn status effect
  graphics don't look right
  how is it different from the chemical dot

mod - nails do poison damage

mod - increase laser bot range, and reduce energy drain

mod - mines become a turret that fires nails
  it could float to the mouse location on fire

dash - mod  when pressing left or right on the ground, teleport to the right until you find an obstruction
  do repeated horizontal zone queries until they hit map or block
  up to a max range of like 10 player widths
  this didn't work as a field, but maybe as a gun?

mod - blocks stun mobs

mod or field - turn blocks into spores or drones

mod - robot that attack nearby mobs, and delivers a stun status effect
  use laser bot code for the attack
  large and 5 sided?

settings - auto aim at nearest mob
settings - custom keys binding

mod - energy recharges faster when not moving

atmosphere levels: change the pace, give the user a rest between combat
  low or no combat, but more graphics
  explore lore
    find power ups in "wrecked" mechs representing previous simulations
      how you could leave something in one simulation that effects a different simulation
        Maybe some strange quantum physics principle.
    add text for player thoughts?
  simple puzzles
  cool looking stuff
    large rotating fan that the player has to move through
    nonaggressive mobs
    in the final level you see your self at the starting level, with the wires
      you shoot your self to wake up?

MOB sniper - targeting laser, then a high speed, no gravity bullet

css transition for pause menu

mod: do extra damage based on your speed
  do more damage when not moving?
  take less damage when not moving?

gun/field: portals
  use the code from mines to get them to stick to walls
    or lasers
  alternate red and blue portals
  
weekly random challenge where everyone playing each week gets the same random setup.
  The randomness would be determined by the date so it would sync everyone.
  power ups still drop, but the drops are determined by a preset list that changes each week.

mod: do something at the end of each level
  heal to full
    should still be effected by the heal reduction at higher difficulty
  give ammo to current gun
  give goals/quests for each level
    how to track goals?
    take no damage
    don't shoot

gun:  Spirit Bomb (singularity)
  use charge up like rail gun
  electricity graphics like plasma torch
  suck in nearby mobs, power ups?, blocks?
    sucked in stuff increase size
  uses energy
  hold above the player's head

Boss levels
  sensor that locks you in after you enter the boss room
  boss that eats other mobs and gains stats from them
    chance to spawn on any level (past level 5)

add a key that player picks up and needs to set on the exit door to open it

make power ups keep moving to player if the pickup field is turned off before they get picked up
  not sure how to do this without adding a constant check

animate new level spawn by having the map aspects randomly fly into place

new map with repeating endlessness
  get ideas from Manifold Garden game
  if falling, get teleported above the map
    I tried it, but had trouble getting the camera to adjust to the teleportation
    this can apply to blocks mobs, and power ups as well
    
give mobs more animal-like behaviors
  like rain world
  give mobs something to do when they don't see player
    explore map
    eat power ups
      drop power up (if killed after eating one)
  mobs some times aren't aggressive
    when low on life or after taking a large hit
  mobs can fight each other
    this might be hard to code
  isolated mobs try to group up.
    
game mechanics
  mechanics that support the physics engine
    add rope/constraint
  get ideas from game: limbo / inside
  environmental hazards
    laser
    lava
  button / switch
  door
  fizzler
  moving platform
  map zones
    water
    low friction ground
    bouncy ground
