after you die, you can find the build you used in the custom menu

shooterBoss - smaller, but more massive,
  aims better at short range, and fires faster
bomberBoss fires faster, bombs are more likely to split

mod: osmoprotectant - stunned or frozen mobs cause no harm

************** TODO - n-gon **************

after you die custom should be populated with your last build
also you should be able to share while paused

standing wave harmonics mod - push things away
  push scales with mass up to about 4
    has a 25% effect on shielded mobs?
  push when using field key
  or push away at the peak of an oscillation
  or always push

give drones bremstranlung radiation?
  name: micro-harmonics?
  reduce drone life span by 50%
  drone drain energy on hits?

add tailed level boss to random pool?

hit scan bullets -> nails

mod: frozen mobs can't do collision damage
  also stunned mobs can't do collision damage
  or they do reduced damage

new gun or field - fire 3+ balls in arc
  name: something about energy
  does damage in area, like neutron bomb
  ends on contact with wall, doesn't stick or bounce
  hold fire to charge: increases the size of the balls
  mod: balls are attracted to mobs

fix: even with a scroll bar the top of the selection window is off screen for very short windows

rework perfect diamagnetism
  let the shield also do bremsstrahlung radiation
  mod: grab and launch mobs?

getting stuck above a mob can immobilize player
  seems to only occur with Pauli exclusion
    add a knock to player mob collisions even while player is immune to damage
      keep the knock very small

map element - player rotates a rotor that makes a platform go up or down

removing supersaturation sets total health to 1
  this cancels the health benefits from crystallized armor
  produce a method that calculates max health based on mods

use mac automator to speed up your n-gon -> git sync

fix door.isOpen actually meaning isClosed

mod - laser fires 3 beams

give missiles a suck and delay explosion, like vacuum bomb

bot that does AOE damage while it rotates around player
  no physics / collisions
  cap 3 ?

level Boss: fractal Sierpi≈Ñski triangle
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle
  spawns a 1/2 size version of the boss, this version can also spawn a smaller version, but it is capped at some size level
    they spawn once at the start of the level
    if a version dies, one can be replaced every ten seconds by the largest version

level element:  a zone with wind, anti-gravity, extra gravity
  control with button

give mobs more animal-like behaviors like rain world
  mobs play, look for food, explore
  mobs some times aren't aggressive
    when low on life or after taking a large hit
  mobs can fight each other
    this might be hard to code
  isolated mobs try to group up

map: laboratory
  rooms with switches that change physics
    gravity room
    portal room
    laser room
    radiation room
  a button that spawns a heal.

mob: wall mounted guns / lasers
  not part of randomized mob pool, customized to each level

atmosphere levels
  change the pace, give the user a rest between combat
  low or no combat, but more graphics
  explore lore
    find power ups in "wrecked" mechs representing previous simulations
      how you could leave something in one simulation that effects a different simulation
        Maybe some strange quantum physics principle.
    add text for player thoughts?
  simple puzzles
  cool looking stuff
    in the final level you see your self at the starting level, with the wires
      you shoot your self to wake up?
  nonaggressive mobs

lore - a robot (the player) gains self awareness
  each mod/gun/field is a new tech
    all the technology leads to the singularity
  each game run is actually the mech simulating a possible escape
    this is why the graphics are so bad, its just a simulation
    final mod is "this is just a simulation"
      you get immortality and Infinity damage
      the next level is the final level
  when you die with Quantum Immortality there is a chance of lore text
  can the (robot)
    (escape captivity, and learn new technology)
    while managing (health, energy, negatives of technological upgrades)
    to overcome the (mobs, dangerous levels)
    to achieve a (technological singularity/positive technological feedback loop)

new gun - deploy a turret that last for 20 seconds
  fire nails at nearby targets once a second.
  use mine code and bot code
mod - mines become a turret that fires nails
  it could float to the mouse location on fire

level boss: fires a line intersection in a random direction every few seconds.
  the last two intersections have a destructive laser between them.

map: observatory
  button controls rotation of telescope
  laser beam shoots out of telescope
  button opens the dome

map: prison
  doors linked to buttons
    mobs inside the doors?

mod - do 50% more damage in close, but 50% less at a distance
  code it like mod.isFarAwayDmg
    have these mods disable each other

phase field still isn't fun
  does phase field need the stealth flag?

mod harmonic shield: slow everything in range around shield (temporal shield)
  set max speed?

mod: bot very slowly follows you and gives you a bonus when it's in range
  it moves through walls
  effect: damage bonus?, damage reduction?, push away mobs, limit top speed of mobs/blocks/player?

graphic idea:  bezier curve that moves smoothly from mob to mob
  loops around player

movement fluidity
  let legs jump on mobs, but player will still take damage
  like: ori and the blind forest, celeste
    many of the movement abilities in these games require levels to be built around the ability
  general feeling of responsiveness and control
  coyote time: can still jump a few cycles after leaving ground
  mod: double jump
  mod: air dash
  mod: wall jump
    wall grab?
  maybe remove falling damage and block damage?

bug - mines spawn extra mines when fired at thin map wall while jumping

redblobgames.com/articles/visibility
  https://github.com/Silverwolf90/2d-visibility/tree/master/src
  could apply to explosions, neutron bomb, player LOS

possible names for mods
  holonomy -  parallel transport of a vector leads to movement (applies to curved space)
  Hypergolic - A hypergolic propellant combination used in a rocket engine is one whose components spontaneously ignite when they come into contact with each other.

have a mob apply a positive status effect on other mobs,
  heal?
  make it yellow
  damage bonus, but how?
  possible balance issues

boss levels - small levels just a boss, and maybe a few mobs
  boss level for timeSkipBoss because of game instability for boss on normal levels
    this might not fix issues

an effect when canceling a power up
  ammo? heals?
  50% chance for a mod, 25% heal, 25% ammo

add player Scent Trails for mob navigation
  https://abitawake.com/news/articles/enemy-ai-chasing-a-player-without-navigation2d-or-a-star-pathfinding

settings - custom keys binding

css transition for pause menu

gun:  Spirit Bomb (singularity)
  use charge up like rail gun
  electricity graphics like plasma torch
  suck in nearby mobs, power ups?, blocks?
    sucked in stuff increase size
  uses energy
  hold above the player's head

animate new level spawn by having the map aspects randomly fly into place
